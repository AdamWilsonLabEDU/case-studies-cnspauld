## Introduction

This document presents a time series analysis of CO₂ concentrations measured at Mauna Loa.

## Plot of CO₂ Data

```{r}
# Load necessary packages
library(readr)
library(ggplot2)

# Read the data from NOAA FTP server
url <- "ftp://aftp.cmdl.noaa.gov/products/trends/co2/co2_annmean_mlo.txt"
co2_data <- read_table(url, col_names = c("Year", "Mean", "Interpolated"), skip = 45, cols(
  Year = col_double(),
  Mean = col_double(),
  Interpolated = col_double()
))

# Create the time series plot
ggplot(co2_data, aes(x = Year, y = Mean)) +
  geom_line(color = "blue", size = 1) +
  labs(title = "Annual Mean CO₂ Concentration at Mauna Loa",
       x = "Year", y = "CO₂ (ppm)") +
  theme_minimal()
```
