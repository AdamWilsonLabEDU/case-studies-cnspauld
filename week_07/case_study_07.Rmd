# Introduction to problem/question
  
# Problem / Question

How has local water chemistry been affected by soil and geologic formations: 
A runoff analysis of chemicals in the water.

# Inspiring Examples

## Example 1

I found this graph in an analysis of water runoff in southeastern New York, where I am from. Although this
graph focuses on pesticide usage and affects, I want to use a similar graph to isolate quantities of certain
compounds and elements that have eroded from the natural landscape into our water sources.

## Example 2

This graph stood out to me as it utilizes elements of rnaturalearth, particularly in the use of a north arrow
and a scale bar. I can use the "annotation_north_arrow" and "annotation_scale" functions to reproduce this.
This map also shows the watersheds in the area, which I can use to overlay my samples from the USGS to find
any similarities.

## Example 3

I selected this graph because of the time component. I want to include how water runoff has changed over
time, and this data from a climate change analysis survey can help me do that. I can also run an analysis
to see if there is any correlation between higher temperatures and water chemistry.

# Proposed data sources

My data will come from multiple sources, including the r packages mentioned in the next section. They
will also come from the local sources such as the Buffalo Niagara Waterkeeper. It's imperative to see
and understand the data from multiple sources and scales in order to make appropriate legislative and
environmental changes at the right scales for the right locations.

# Proposed methods

Packages to be used: grwat, fasstr, dataRetrieval, rmacrostrat, rnaturalearth, among others to be added.

I will use grwat to build off of the capabilities of ggplot2, specifically in order to create maps in order
to identify ground, rain, thaw, and spring runoff. Fasstr and rnaturalearth will help streamline this process
and to create a more complex and interactive map. Rmacrostrat and dataRetrieval will help get me accurate data
from the USGS, as well as incorporating data from the Buffalo Niagara Waterkeeper to create national vs local
maps.

# Expected results

I want to produce maps and graphs, specifically a heat map to look for certain chemicals,
such as nitrogen, sulfur, and phosphorus.
